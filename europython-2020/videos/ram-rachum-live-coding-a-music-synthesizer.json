  "description": "This is going to be a fun live-coding session using NumPy and SoundDevice. The goal of this talk is to make the computer produce realistic-sounding instrument sounds, using nothing but math.\n\nAll the code will be written live and we'll hear the audio that it produces.\n\nWe'll start with creating a simple sound using a sine wave. We’ll gradually make it sound more like a real instrument, learning a little\nbit about music theory on the way. We’ll add features one-by-one until by the end of the talk, we’ll hear our synthesizer play a piece\nof classical music.\n",
